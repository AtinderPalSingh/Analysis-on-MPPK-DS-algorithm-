# Analysis-on-MPPK-DS-algorithm-
This is a work of multivariate polynomial public key based digital signature algorithm, originally proposed by - Randy Kuang, Maria Perepechaenko and Michel Barbeau. 
Originally the work is proposed here " A new quantum-safe multivariate polynomial public key digital signature algorithm". a new quantum-safe digital signature algorithm called Multivariate Polynomial Public Key Digital Signature (MPPK/DS). The core of the algorithm is based on the modular arithmetic property that for a given element g, greater than equal to two, in a prime Galois field GF(p) and two multivariate polynomials P and Q, if P is equal to Q modulo p-1, then g to the power of P is equal to g to the power of Q modulo p. MPPK/DS is designed to withstand the key-only, chosen-message, and known-message attacks.
We have coded the algorithms in python for the final verification and running considering different scenarios and recorded the performance for the same. 

Also, here are the bifurcated algorithms for keygen , signing and verifying. So first the keygen.py will run independently , which will generate private key "s" and public key "v". These keys will be saved in the files named " private_key.json" and "public_key.json" automatically and will replace the contents of these files every time the keygen.py is run. Now  for sign.py , it will take private key "s" and message "mu"( any message saved on your pc- just need to change the name in code) , so further, sign.py signs the message and generated a digital signature "t". Furthermore, this digital signature "t" is saved in another file named " digital_signature.json" and every time replaces the contents once new signature is generated. Finally for the verifying at alice , verify.py will take both the public key "v" and digital signature "t" from saved files and generates the verdict if valid or not.
