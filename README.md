# Analysis-on-MPPK-DS-algorithm-
This is a work of multivariate polynomial public key based digital signature algorithm, originally proposed by - Randy Kuang, Maria Perepechaenko and Michel Barbeau. 
Originally the work is proposed here " A new quantum-safe multivariate polynomial public key digital signature algorithm". a new quantum-safe digital signature algorithm called Multivariate Polynomial Public Key Digital Signature (MPPK/DS). The core of the algorithm is based on the modular arithmetic property that for a given element g, greater than equal to two, in a prime Galois field GF(p) and two multivariate polynomials P and Q, if P is equal to Q modulo p-1, then g to the power of P is equal to g to the power of Q modulo p. MPPK/DS is designed to withstand the key-only, chosen-message, and known-message attacks.
We have coded the algorithms in python for the final verification and running considering different scenarios and recorded the performance for the same.
